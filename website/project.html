<h2>Reconstructing Netflix: Buy vs Rent<h2> 
<h4>A Ditributed Video Streaming service</h4> 
Aditya Rao, Raghuram SV, and Kunal Lillaney<br><br><br> 
 
<b>Overview</b><br> Netflix, in 2012, with about 30 million subscribers makes up approximately 30% of downstream traffic in the US. 
Internet has overtaken cable tv as the most used form of watching content.<br> 
<br> We explore the possibility of deploying a service like Netflix and the challenges faced in delivering content over the internet. We carefully analyzed 
the deployment model used by Netflix and derived a conclusion that using only rented systems would not prove cost effective in the long run and would lead to complete 
dependency on an external provider. Our system is designed to use the best of both worlds and is deployable in tandem on both built and leased datacenters
( example Amazon AWS). Openstack is used to simulate Amazon's AWS, Wowza Media Server is used to stream content and Spread is used to allocate resources. <br>
